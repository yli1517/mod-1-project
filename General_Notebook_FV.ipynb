    "The purpose of this analysis is to figure out movie production variables that contribute to box office success. The datasets we used for analysis came from IMDB and The-Numbers, and the key variables that we focused on were movie titles, movie genres, time of release, production budget, and worldwide gross income. Our preliminary findings showed that genres and time of movie release seemed to contribute to box office success. Among different types of movie genres, 1) Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, 2) Action, Adventure, Animation, and 3) Action, Adventure, Comedy are the most popular movie genres; and the best time to release a movie is during early summertime rather than holiday season."

It may also determine the likelihood of the movie making money. Also, the time that a movie should be released, whether is to target summertime or holiday season, is another thing for a filmaker to consider about.  "
